                Each and every modern webpage that we create today tend to have
                user interactions. When the user interacts with the web
                application events are fired. That event can be a mouse click, a
                keypress, or something rare like connecting the battery with a
                charger. From the developer side, we need to ‘listen’ to such
                events and then make our application respond accordingly. This
                is called event handling that provides a dynamic interface to a
                webpage. Like JavaScript DOM, React also provides us some
                built-in methods to create a listener that responds accordingly
                to a specific event.Now we will look at certain rules to keep in
                mind while creating events in React. camelCase Convention:
                Instead of using lowercase we use camelCase while giving names
                of the react events. That simply means we write ‘onClick’
                instead of ‘onclick’. Pass the event as a function: In React we
                pass a function enclosed by curly brackets as the event listener
                or event handler, unlike HTML where we pass the event handler or
                event listener as a string. Prevent the default: Just returning
                false inside the JSX element does not prevent the default
                behavior in react. Instead, we have to call the ‘preventDefault’
                method directly inside the event handler function. Each and
